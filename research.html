        <td valign="top"><p>1.My research interest is artificial intelligence algorithm. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robots, language recognition, image recognition, natural language processing and expert systems. Since the birth of AI, the theory and technology have become increasingly mature, and the application field has also been expanding. It can be imagined that the scientific and technological products brought by AI in the future will be the "container" of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like people and may exceed human intelligence.<br />

            &#160;2.In addition, I usually pay attention to some content about blockchain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block contains a certain amount of information, which is connected into a chain according to their respective time sequence. This chain is stored in all servers. As long as one server in the whole system can work, the whole blockchain is safe. These servers are called nodes in the blockchain system, and they provide storage space and computing support for the entire blockchain system. If you want to modify the information in the blockchain, you must obtain the consent of more than half of the nodes and modify the information in all nodes. These nodes are usually in the hands of different subjects, so it is extremely difficult to tamper with the information in the blockchain. Compared with traditional networks, blockchain has two core characteristics: first, data is difficult to tamper with, and second, decentralization. Based on these two characteristics, the information recorded by the blockchain is more authentic and reliable, which can help solve the problem of mutual distrust.<br />

            &#160;3.Recently, my research focuses on improving the reliability and robustness of AI algorithms. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence "AI", how to avoid the decision-making bias caused by its own technical defects has attracted the attention of the industry. At present, artificial intelligence technology is accelerating its development and has profoundly changed people's lifestyle. Data privacy, algorithm discrimination, security risks and other intelligent governance issues have also attracted the attention of all parties.

With the further development of AI application, its own technical defects, decision-making bias and security issues have triggered a trust crisis, and credibility has become the focus of attention. "At present, artificial intelligence technology is accelerating its development, which has profoundly changed people's production and lifestyle. The following intelligent governance issues, such as data privacy, algorithm discrimination and security risks, have also attracted the attention of all parties." At the forum, Shang Yuying, Deputy Secretary General of Shanghai Municipal Government, took the lead in proposing the development of reliable AI and the promotion of AI transparency. The diversity of security and control has become a global consensus.<br />
